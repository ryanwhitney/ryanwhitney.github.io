      <p><strong>The</strong> pale Usher&mdash;threadbare in coat, heart, body, and brain; I see him now. He was ever dusting his old lexicons and grammars, with a queer handkerchief, mockingly embellished with all the gay flags of all the known nations of the world. He loved to dust his old grammars; it somehow mildly reminded him of his mortality.</p>

      <p><strong>It</strong> will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and grub-worm of a poor devil of a Sub-Sub appears to have gone through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, picking up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways find in any book whatsoever, sacred or profane. Therefore you must not, in every case at least, take the higgledy-piggledy whale statements, however authentic, in these extracts, for veritable gospel cetology. Far from it. As touching the ancient authors generally, as well as the poets here appearing, these extracts are solely valuable or entertaining, as affording a glancing bird&rsquo;s eye view of what has been promiscuously said, thought, fancied, and sung of Leviathan, by many nations and generations, including our own.</p>
        <p>So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am. Thou belongest to that hopeless, sallow tribe which no wine of this world will ever warm; and for whom even Pale Sherry would be too rosy-strong; but with whom one sometimes loves to sit, and feel poor-devilish, too; and grow convivial upon tears; and say to them bluntly, with full eyes and empty glasses, and in not altogether unpleasant sadness&mdash;Give it up, Sub-Subs! For by how much the more pains ye take to please the world, by so much the more shall ye for ever go thankless! Would that I could clear out Hampton Court and the Tuileries for ye! But gulp down your tears and hie aloft to the royal-mast with your hearts; for your friends who have gone before are clearing out the seven-storied heavens, and making refugees of long-pampered Gabriel, Michael, and Raphael, against your coming. Here ye strike but splintered hearts together&mdash;there, ye shall strike unsplinterable glasses!</p>

        <strong>Call</strong> me Ishmael. Some years ago&mdash;never mind how long precisely&mdash;having
        little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on
        shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of
        the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the
        circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever
        it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself
        involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear
        of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get such an
        upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me
        from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking
        people&rsquo;s hats off&mdash;then, I account it high time to get to sea as soon
        as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical
        flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship.
        There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men
        in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings
        towards the ocean with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        There now is your insular city of the Manhattoes, belted round by wharves
        as Indian isles by coral reefs&mdash;commerce surrounds it with her surf.
        Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is
        the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by
        breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the
        crowds of water-gazers there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears
        Hook to Coenties Slip, and from thence, by Whitehall, northward. What do
        you see?&mdash;Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand
        thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some
        leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking
        over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high aloft in the rigging, as
        if striving to get a still better seaward peep. But these are all
        landsmen; of week days pent up in lath and plaster&mdash;tied to counters,
        nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green
        fields gone? What do they here?
      </p>
      <p>
        But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and
        seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the
        extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder
        warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as
        they possibly can without falling in. And there they stand&mdash;miles of
        them&mdash;leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys,
        streets and avenues&mdash;north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all
        unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses
        of all those ships attract them thither?
      </p>
      <p>
        Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take
        almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale,
        and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let
        the most absent-minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries&mdash;stand
        that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead
        you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be
        athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan
        happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one
        knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest,
        quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of
        the Saco. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees,
        each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and
        here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder
        cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way,
        reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue.
        But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes
        down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd&rsquo;s head, yet all were vain,
        unless the shepherd&rsquo;s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go
        visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade
        knee-deep among Tiger-lilies&mdash;what is the one charm wanting?&mdash;Water&mdash;there
        is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a cataract of sand, would
        you travel your thousand miles to see it? Why did the poor poet of
        Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate
        whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a
        pedestrian trip to Rockaway Beach? Why is almost every robust healthy boy
        with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to
        sea? Why upon your first voyage as a passenger, did you yourself feel such
        a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out
        of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the
        Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of Jove? Surely all this
        is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of
        Narcissus, who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he
        saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image,
        we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the
        ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to
        grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do
        not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to
        go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag
        unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick&mdash;grow
        quarrelsome&mdash;don&rsquo;t sleep of nights&mdash;do not enjoy themselves
        much, as a general thing;&mdash;no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though
        I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a
        Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to
        those who like them. For my part, I abominate all honorable respectable
        toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as
        much as I can do to take care of myself, without taking care of ships,
        barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,&mdash;though
        I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of
        officer on ship-board&mdash;yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;&mdash;though
        once broiled, judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered,
        there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say
        reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous
        dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse,
        that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bake-houses the
        pyramids.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast,
        plumb down into the forecastle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True,
        they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like
        a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is
        unpleasant enough. It touches one&rsquo;s sense of honor, particularly if you
        come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or
        Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting
        your hand into the tar-pot, you have been lording it as a country
        schoolmaster, making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition
        is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires
        a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to grin and bear
        it. But even this wears off in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
        and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I
        mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the archangel
        Gabriel thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and
        respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain&rsquo;t a
        slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me
        about&mdash;however they may thump and punch me about, I have the
        satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one
        way or other served in much the same way&mdash;either in a physical or
        metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the universal thump is passed
        round, and all hands should rub each other&rsquo;s shoulder-blades, and be
        content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying
        me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I
        ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there
        is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act
        of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two
        orchard thieves entailed upon us. But <i>being paid</i>,&mdash;what will compare
        with it? The urbane activity with which a man receives money is really
        marvellous, considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root
        of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven.
        Ah! how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition!
      </p>

        Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise
        and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are
        far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate
        the Pythagorean maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the
        quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the
        forecastle. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same
        way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same
        time that the leaders little suspect it. But wherefore it was that after
        having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor, I should now take it
        into my head to go on a whaling voyage; this the invisible police officer
        of the Fates, who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs
        me, and influences me in some unaccountable way&mdash;he can better answer
        than any one else. And, doubtless, my going on this whaling voyage, formed
        part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time
        ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more
        extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run
        something like this:

      <blockquote  style="padding: 30px 0;">
        <p style="text-align:center;">

          &ldquo;<i>Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.</i>
          <br/>
          <small>&ldquo;WHALING VOYAGE BY ONE ISHMAEL. </small>
          <br/>
          &ldquo;BLOODY BATTLE IN AFFGHANISTAN.&rdquo;
         </p>
       </blockquote>
      <p>
        Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the
        Fates, put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others
        were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy
        parts in genteel comedies, and jolly parts in farces&mdash;though I cannot
        tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I
        think I can see a little into the springs and motives which being
        cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about
        performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it
        was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating
        judgment.

        Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale
        himself. Such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity.
        Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the
        undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending
        marvels of a thousand Patagonian sights and sounds, helped to sway me to
        my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been
        inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for
        things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on barbarous
        coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and
        could still be social with it&mdash;would they let me&mdash;since it is
        but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one
        lodges in.
      </p>
      <p>
        By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great
        flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that
        swayed me to my purpose, two and two there floated into my inmost soul,
        endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand
        hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.
